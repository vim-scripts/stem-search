StmSrch is a reverse-stem searching script. It implements the Porter stemming algorithm, by Martin Porter. It also handles irregular verbs and noun pluralizations.

This script can be useful for searching or scanning through corpus files.

Each word input to the :StmSrch command will be stemmed and then formulated in such a way as to match possible conjugations or pluralizations. Without any word given for input, it will attempt to stem the current word under the cursor. The matching is done using word boundaries so not just any substring will match.

For example: 
- :StmSrch search 
will match any of: 
- search, searching, searches, searchers, searched, ...
and a string of words will work as well, matching in order: 
- :StmSrch thieves are running from bunnies 
will match strings of words like: 
- thief was ran from bunny 
- thieves be run from bunnies

Search hits are highlighted, and the highlight color can be modified by
editing the color in the s:StmSrchInit() function. The matches will stay 
highlighted even if you search again using the normal &#039/&#039 key. This is
useful for cases where you are browsing through a large corpus file, for 
example and want to see the relative location of matches. 

Use :ClrStmSrch to clear the highlighting for the StmSrch group.

For stemmed words, the search is greedy and may over match. This was useful 
for my purposes. If more exact word endings are required, this can be added.
